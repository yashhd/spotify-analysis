# Analysing spotify listening history and creating models

##Introduction

Being an avid music listener, I accumulated years and years of my spotify listening history, which is over 500 hours of streaming time. I am always on a lookout for discovering new genres of music and enjoy exploring new music. Now with this substantial amount of data, I felt I could do something with it, and I built vlassifiers which could generate song recommendations based on their music taste and let them know whether or not a song is a 'favorite'. The recommendations provided by Spotify are no doubt state of the art. With their discover weekly showcasing new undiscovered songs to the user on a weekly basis. But thereâ€™s a finite number of songs recommended through that feature. With this project, one can generate recommendations based on their own music taste and their past listening history on a large scale.
